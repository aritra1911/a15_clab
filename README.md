# C Programming Lab for section A 15
This includes all the source files for the programs done in the class. Files are
put in subdirectories that are named according to the date the class took place
in YYYY\_MM\_DD format.

## This is a temporary repository
I plan to remove it if it contains pretty basic stuff. If there are bigger
projects built within this course, then I'll be creating seperate repositories
for them.

Thank you for checking out.
